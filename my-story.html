                <h1>My Story</h1>
                <p>My career path and journey to the field of UX and tech more broadly is somewhat different than most. I studied Anthropology, History, and modern languages in college, and I initially wanted to be a teacher and professor. I completed a PhD in History and wrote a dissertation on the impacts of US militarism on women in the Philippines.</p> 
                <p>I really enjoyed academic research and teaching, but I felt like something was missing for me. There was a lot of focus on understanding social problems but not as much on designing solutions. This is what eventually led me to pursue UX design and web development.</p>
                <p>I donâ€™t see myself as starting over in my career, but instead I am blending my previous knowledge and experience with tech skills. My current projects are rooted in a desire to make a positive social impact by focusing on user needs and problems. To do this well, we need to have a solid grasp of the cultures in which we live and the histories that have made us who we are.</p>
