                <p>
                    I wanted to learn how to code because I love the idea that technology can solve social problems. I also wanted to have the skills to be able to create any app or website imaginable. I came to this careerpath in a non-traditional way, as I studied the humanities in college. I actually thought I was going to be a history professor! I wrote a dissertation on the impacts of US militarism on women in the Philippines (which probably only six people have read, but if you're interested you can read more here). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    While I really enjoyed academic work, especially the creativity involved in pursuing a unique research project, I also felt like something was missing for me. Much of the work I was doing felt abstract, and generally it takes many years to see results (historians often spend decades working on a book before it gets published). This is what eventually led me to pursue UX design and web development.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    I donâ€™t see myself as starting over in my career, but rather building on my previous work with a new, more technical, skillset. In my academic projects, I wanted to make a positive social impact through research. My new goal centers 
                    I hope to do the same through creating apps and websites that focus on user needs and problems.
